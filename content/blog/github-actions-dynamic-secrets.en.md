It's been a while since I've been in love with [Github Actions][gh-main].
More than a year ago, the (very kind) people at Github opened the beta for
[Github Actions Environments][gh-blog], with the fantastic
[Environment Secrets][gh-env-secrets]

[gh-main]: https://github.com/features/actions
[gh-blog]: https://github.blog/changelog/2020-12-15-github-actions-environments-environment-protection-rules-and-environment-secrets-beta/
[gh-env-secrets]: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment#environment-secrets



- Showcase feature (Environments, Environment Secrets)
- Show context, introduce "problem"
- Show solutions (simple & shared)
- Show how to setup / adapt
